        <description>It takes guts to open a restaurant in Times Square that lacks a theme or strives to be classier than a carnival.

Mayson Bacon Jr. has succeeded finding a perfect balance between class and bacon. And to repeat what I'm saying: It takes guts to open a restaurant in Times Square that lacks a theme or strives to be classier than a carnival.</description>
