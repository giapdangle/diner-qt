\title QML Restaurant App example 

The Restaurant example application demonstrates how QML can be used to build a 
simple, impressive catalog-type application based on local XML data. It is 
straightforward to convert the application to use internet resources instead of 
local XML-resources. The application is designed in such a way that it is easy 
to replace the content and visual style for different restaurants.
