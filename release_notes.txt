Diner v1.5
==========

The Diner example application demonstrates how QML can be used to build a
simple, impressive catalog-type application based on local XML data. It is
straightforward to convert the application to use internet resources instead of
local XML resources. The application is designed in such a way that it is easy
to replace the content and visual style for different restaurants. The
application utilises the Qt Quick Components throughout, for example in the
navigation (PageStack, ToolBar), Dialogs, Buttons, and so on.

This application features tab-based navigation, using TabGroup and ToolBar
components. The UI of the updated version is implemented using mostly Qt Quick
Components, but it also has some custom graphics and UI elements, designed to
be reusable in other applications as well. The booking view also introduces the
experimental com.nokia.extras components, namely DatePicker and TimePicker.
